Title: Seabirds in crisis: plastic ingestion induces proteomic signatures of multi-organ failure and neurodegeneration

R Code for bioinformatics of mass-spectroscopy proteomic data investing the effects of plastic ingestion in a non-model organism (Flesh-footed Shearwater Ardenna carneipes. 
Code file: Seabirds Plastics Proteomics Bioinformatic Pipeline.Rmd

Requires 4 data files to run, 
    1. 2306_AdJ_NCBI.txt
            This is available for download on ProteinXchange. It contains the raw data from the mass spectrometry. 
    2. Protein_symbols_GitHub.csv
            Contains the protein symbols of the proteins identified in by the mass spectrometry. 
    3. Seabird_proteomic_sample_information.csv
            Contains the plastic count and body morphometric data associated with each sample. 
    4. Secreted_intracellular_significant.csv
            Proteins mapped to organ location and secreted or intracellular.
